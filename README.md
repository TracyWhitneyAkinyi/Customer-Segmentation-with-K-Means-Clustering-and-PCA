# Customer-Segmentation-with-K-Means-Clustering-and-PCA

In this project we are going to perform one of the applications of unsupervised machine learning - customer segmentation.In this project, we will implement customer segmentation in R.

In this project we will explore the data by performing descriptive analysis, exploratory analysis and implement different versions of K-means algorithm.
Customer segmentation is the process by which you divide your customers into segments up based on common characteristics â€“ such as demographics or behaviors, so you can market to those customers more effectively.Using clustering techniques, companies can identify the several segments of customers allowing them to target the potential user base. In this machine learning project, we will make use of K-means clustering which is the essential algorithm for clustering unlabeled data set.

Companies that deploy customer segmentation are under the notion that every customer has different requirements and require a specific marketing effort to address them appropriately.

# *K - means Algorithm*

While using the k-means clustering algorithm, the first step is to indicate the number of clusters (k) that we wish to produce in the final output. The algorithm starts by selecting k objects from data set randomly that will serve as the initial centers for our clusters.

While working with clusters, you need to specify the number of clusters to use. You would like to utilize the optimal number of clusters. To help you in determining the optimal clusters, there are two popular methods

 *Elbow method.
 
 *Silhouette method.
