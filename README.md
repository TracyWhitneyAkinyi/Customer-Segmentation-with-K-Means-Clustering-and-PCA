# Customer-Segmentation-with-K-Means-Clustering-and-PCA

In this project we are going to perform one of the applications of unsupervised machine learning - customer segmentation.In this project, we will implement customer segmentation in R.

In this project we will explore the data by performing descriptive analysis, exploratory analysis and implement different versions of K-means algorithm.
Customer segmentation is the process by which you divide your customers into segments up based on common characteristics â€“ such as demographics or behaviors, so you can market to those customers more effectively.Using clustering techniques, companies can identify the several segments of customers allowing them to target the potential user base. In this machine learning project, we will make use of K-means clustering which is the essential algorithm for clustering unlabeled data set.

Companies that deploy customer segmentation are under the notion that every customer has different requirements and require a specific marketing effort to address them appropriately.
